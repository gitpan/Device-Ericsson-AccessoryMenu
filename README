README for Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu 0.8

=head1 NAME

Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu - allows use of a T68i as a remote control

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $remote = Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu->new;
 $remote->menu( [ 'Remote' => [ pause  => sub { ... },
                                Volume => [ up   => sub { ... },
                                            down => sub { ... },
                                          ],
                              ],
                ] );

 # on Win32, Win32::SerialPort should be equivalent
 my $port = Device::SerialPort->new('/dev/rfcomm0')
    or die "couldn't connect to T68i";
 $remote->port( $port );

 $remote->register_menu;

 while (1) {
     $remote->control;
 }

What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.8	Monday 8th March, 2004

	Applied the following patch by Arne Georg Gleditsch:
		Added examples/x11pointer
		Added xmms playlist clear/add directory to examples/remote 
		Reworking of the timeout code to allow for better co-operation
		with foreign event loops.
		Setting of the default charset
	Thanks Arne!


=item 0.7	Monday 22nd September, 2003

	Fixed a packageing mistake - we weren't shipping 
	lib/Device/Ericsson/AccessoryMenu/Mouse.pm due to a glitch in
	MANIFEST.SKIP



=item 0.6	Wednesday 25th June, 2003

	Rewrote everything to be stateful.  We now have a stack of
	states.  You can enter a new state, or exit and query the
	current state. The current state's handle method will be
	invoked for each line received by ->control

	It is expected that states will be based on, or at least
	implement the interface of Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu::State, 
 	and that they will be named Device::Ericsson::AccessoryMenu::$state.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE moved send_menu over to Menu->on_enter

	reimplemented send_text as a thin shim around enter_state( 'Text' )

	implemented mouse_move as a similar shim

	worked over examples/remote to be much more functional
